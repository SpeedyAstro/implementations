         * a data structure is a particular way to organize , manage and store data.
         * it is a set of algorithm which can be implemented through programming language
         * 
         * -> Operations that can be performed with dsa -
         * 1. searching 
         * 2. sorting
         * 3. Insertion
         * 4. Deletion
         * 5. updation
         * 
         * Advantages - 
         * 1. we can process the data easily
         * 2. it stores the data very efficiently in memory
         * 3. ds is used to develop algorithms
         * 4. it stores the data in a secured way
         * 
         * -> Types of ds 
         * 1. primitive ds 
         * 2. non primitive ds
         *      -> linear ds (string,files,arrays,lists,stacks,queues)
         *  = in linear ds the data is arranged in a sequential form ie. one element is connected to only one other element in linear form 
         *      -> Non linear ds (graphs , trees)
         *      = in non linear ds , one element can connect with n number of elements
