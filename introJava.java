 * 
 * WHAT IS JAVA ?
 *  Java is High level object oriented programming language
 *  platform : java is a platform because java has its own runtime enviroment
 * 
 * 
 * Editions of java
 * 1. J2SE : JAVA 2 STANDARD EDITION (CORE JAVA) - JAVA FUNDAMENTAL  -> PROJECTS : STANDALONE APPLICATION
 * 2. J2EE : JAVA 2 ENTERPRISE EDITION (ADVANCE JAVA) 
 *      -> Server Side programming  -> Projects : Enterprise Applications
 * 3. J2ME : JAVA 2 MICRO EDITION (ITS HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ANDROID)
 * -> Microprogramming  -> projects : Mobile based applications 
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * JAVA HISTORY :
 *  -> COMPANY : SUN MICROSYSTEM (ORACLE)
 *  -> DESIGNED BY : JAMES GOSLING 
 *  -> IDEA : SIMPLE, PLATFORM INDEPENDENT , TIGHT CODED PROGRAMMING ETC
 *  -> NAME : OAK (JAVA)
 *  -> YEAR : 1991 (DEVELOPEMT) --> 1995 (RELEASED)
 *   
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Difference between C, C++ & JAVA 
 * 1) PROGRAMMING PARADIGM : 
 *  C --> PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE
 *  C++ --> OOPS (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
 *  JAVA --> PURE OOPS - 99%
 *  2) ORIGIN :
 *  C--> BASED ON ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
 *  C++ --> BASED ON C
 *  JAVA --> BASED ON C AND C++
 * 3) DESIGND BY / YEAR:
 *  C   --> DENNIS RITCHIE /1972
 *  C++ --> BJARNE STROUSTRUP / 1979
 *  JAVA -> JAMES GOSLING / 1995
 * 
 * 4) TRANSLATOR :
 *  C - COMPILER
 *  C++ - COMPILER
 *  JAVA - INTERPRETER AND COMPILER
 * 
 * 5) STATIC / DYNAMIC : [Static means values are attached to types ('compiled') at compile time. Dynamic means they are attached ('interpreted') at runtime.]
 *  C - STATIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
 *  C++ - STATIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
 *  JAVA - STATIC 
 * 
 * 6) Platform Dependent / Independent :
 *  C   -   Platform Dependent
 *  C++ -   Platform Dependent
 *  Java  - Platform Independent
 * 
 * 7) Pointers :
 *  Java do not support pointer
 * 
 * 8) Call by value / call by reference
 *  c - supports both 
 *  c++ - supprots both 
 *  java - supports only call by value
 * 
 * Java is machine independent because it do not support pointers 
 * as in pointer variable store address of some data , since if this program run on differnent OS , then pointer variable search for that address that dont exists on differenct machine , therefore java do not support pointer so it make possible to run on every device
 * 
 * java don not support call by reference since it do not support pointers 
 * 
 * why java has good memory managment >
 * java has a special feature for memory management that is garbage collection , since it automatically clear out the data that is not being used or pointed to anything
 * 
 * 
 * Machine Learning libraries in JAVA  : Weka , Mallet , Deeplearning4j ,MOA etc
 * In python - TensorFlow , pytorch
 * 
 * JAVA FEATURES : 
 *  1 SIMPLE : USES SIMPLIFIED SYNTAX FROM C AND C++
 *  2 SOME C AND C++ FEATURES WERE EITHER REMOVED (POINTERS ,MULTIPLE INHERITANCE) FOR MAKE SOME OF THEM AUTOMATIC (MEMORY MANGEMENT)
 * 
 * JAVA IS PLATFORM INDEPENDENT 
 * JAVA CAN EXECUTE ON ANY MACHINE , BUT MACHINE SHOULD HAVE JRE COMPATIBLE FOR THAT MACHINE
 * 
 * security :
 *  java does not have pointers 
 *  java has byte code verifier
 *  java has a security manager that defines the access of java classes
 * 
 * robust : 
 * java provides alot of classes and interfaces to handle exceptions 
 * 
 * Multithreaded language : 
 *  java supports multithreading 
 * 
 * high performace : 
 *  robust , portable ,
 * 
 * 
 * jdk - jre - jdk + predefined libraries 
 * 
 * How does Kotlin compares to java
